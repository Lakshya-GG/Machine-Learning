# Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains materials and codes for Machine Learning, covers a wide range of topics including supervised learning, advanced learning algorithms, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.

## Tools Used
- Python programming language
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- TensorFlow for neural network implementation
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and visualization

## Final Outcome
At the end of this we should be able to:
- Implement supervised learning algorithms for regression and classification tasks
- Understand and apply advanced learning algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees
- Utilize unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and anomaly detection
- Build recommender systems using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches
- Develop reinforcement learning algorithms, as demonstrated by the implementation of Deep Q-Learning for landing the Lunar Lander.

## Lunar Lander Landing with Deep Q-Learning
 Involves training an agent using Deep Q-Learning to land a Lunar Lander successfully. After many unsuccessful attempts in learning how to do it, the rover was trained to land correctly on the surface, precisely between the flags as indicators. The final landing achieved after training the agent using appropriate parameters showcases the effectiveness of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm in solving complex tasks.
